            title: "Determination"
            summary: "Haseo emerges from inactivity after his defeat at the hands of Tri-Edge. He encounters Tohta and learns that Phyllo died of cancer, making Haseo miss him. Haseo then meets with Tabby and she tell him her real life ambitions of becoming a nurse so that she can save Shino before Haseo. Once Tabby leaves and Haseo is left alone, the episode recaps the events during the series between Shino and Haseo. This leads to a scene in which Haseo sees a ghost of Shino, making his convictions to save her grow stronger. The episode ends with a brief glimpse of Haseo, his Xth Form from the G.U. games superimposed over his normal character and the avatar Skeith in the background. The image transitions back to the present Haseo looking into the distance, his determination renewed to continue his search for Tri-Edge and a way to save Shino."

            title: "Returner"
            summary: "This episode takes place after the G.U. game trilogy. The characters of both Roots and the G.U. receive an email from Ovan requesting them to visit the festival held at a new Lost Ground, Hidden Forbidden Festival. There, they encounter many old friends, as well as an AIDA who appears to be non-hostile. At the end of the episode, Ovan is reunited with his sister Aina, who has been comatose since before the beginning of both Roots and G.U. This episode was shipped to people who had completed all three .Hack//G.U games as a reward and was thus not included in the original series. It was only made available to the japanese customers, and there are no foreseeable plans to bring Returner to other parts of the world."
